# HandsomMLmaster – Sprint 3  

This repository contains the work developed during **Sprint 3** of the GitHub and Digital Repository Management challenge.  

## 🎯 Objective  
The main goal of this sprint was to practice the creation and management of branches, generate a merge conflict, and resolve it properly in GitHub.  

## ⚙️ Activities Performed  
- Created two branches: **A** and **B** from the main branch.  
- Modified the file `docs.txt` with different content in each branch.  
- Used commands such as `git pull`, `git checkout -b`, `git add .`, `git commit -m ""`, and `git push origin`.  
- Opened Pull Requests to compare and merge changes.  
- Experienced a merge conflict between branches A and B.  
- Resolved the conflict manually by combining the content and committing the changes.  

## ✅ Results  
- Learned how to structure changes independently in branches without affecting the main branch.  
- Understood how merge conflicts occur and how to solve them.  
- Gained confidence in using GitHub as a collaboration tool for version control.  

## 🔍 How to Review  
- The commits and branches can be explored directly in this repository.  
- Pull Requests created during this sprint illustrate the conflict and its resolution.
